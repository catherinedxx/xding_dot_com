abstract: Abstract Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support
  the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy-absorbing
  systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. Here, mechanical metamaterials based
  on hinged quadrilaterals are used as a platform to realize target nonlinear mechanical
  responses. It is first shown that by changing the shape of the quadrilaterals, the
  amount of internal rotations induced by the applied compression can be tuned, and
  a wide range of mechanical responses is achieved. Next, a neural network is introduced
  that provides a computationally inexpensive relationship between the parameters
  describing the geometry and the corresponding stressâ€“strain response. Finally, it
  is shown that by combining the neural network with an evolution strategy, one can
  efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical
  responses and design optimized energy-absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing
  structures.
