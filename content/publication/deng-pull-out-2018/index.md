abstract: This paper deals with the interfacial bonding performance of the steel fiber
  in the steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced cementitious composite. 42 groups
  of straight and hooked-end steel fiber specimens are investigated by the single-sided
  pull-out tests. The whole pull-out load-slip responses are captured, and the effects
  of hybrid fiber dosage, matrix strength and fiber embedded length are analyzed.
  Furthermore, the interfacial bonding mechanism and fiber reinforcing mechanism are
  revealed based on SEM images. Results show that the addition of hybrid fibers in
  the matrix contributes significantly to increasing the maximum and residual pull-out
  load as well as improving the pull-out energy dissipation capacity. The polypropylene
  fiber content is found to be the dominant factor for the variation of interfacial
  properties. For straight steel fiber, the enhancing effect of hybrid fiber on the
  chemical adhesion force is more pronounced than that on the sliding frictional force.
  For hooked-end steel fiber, the contribution of hybrid fiber is not significant
  on the hook mechanical interlocking. Finally, a theoretical model is developed to
  predict the pull-out behavior with the hybrid fiber effect taken into account. The
  predictions provide satisfactory correlation to the experimental results from both
  the current study and previous work.
